# MiniWait

You're sick but you don't want to sit in the health clinic with other sick people for two hours. What if you knew when the wait time was small?

I hate waiting. I bet you do too. There's only two things standing between us and a virtually wait-free world: Some decent software and the process of getting suppliers we like to use it.

Why customers want this is obvious -- Who wants to grow cobwebs in a waiting room somewhere?

Company managers have several reasons for using it:

* They want to smooth out the flow of customers
* They want to make their customers happy
* They want to know who else might be waiting to come in
* They want to know how their wait times vary across multiple locations

There are lots of companies who don't take appointments -- you just have to sit and wait. This is an application that will spread because of its usefulness, its cool factor and because competitors will use it to gain market share.

Wait times cost businesses big money: http://www.inc.com/graham-winfrey/the-cost-of-customer-service-wait-times.html
